Make a Difference
Friends of SFACC is a registered 501 (c)(3) nonprofit and is an all-volunteer-run organization. Our federal EIN (employer identification number for tax-exempt verification).<br>
<br>
Your gift makes it possible to provide programs, supplies, and awareness of the services provided to animals and people in San Francisco by the Dept. of Animal Care & Control. Donating to Friends of SFACC directly (rather than to the city fund for the shelter), ensures that the funds go toward helping the animals in ways that are outside the scope of the City budget. Gifts of any size make a difference. We thank you for your generous support!<br>
